      <description>We also do home visits. In practice we have all the necessary equipment available, so it is preferable to come to us with your pet. If that is not possible, we will come to you at a slightly higher rate than a practical consultation. Please give us a call to book your home visit  üìû (&amp;#43;32) 475 20 78 79  .</description>

      <description>The practice is mainly focused on the treatment (care &amp;amp; operations) of small pets, such as cats, dogs and rabbits. For all other pets, we also try to help you as best as possible, or we send you to specialists in the field.</description>

      <description>When we moved to St-Martens-Latem in 2007, I was looking for a vet for my dog ‚Äã‚Äãand cats. An acquaintance recommended Pascale to me. Trust is very important to me and I have certainly found that with Pascale. My pets are really a part of my life, and when they are sick, Pascale is always there for them. Pascale, thank you for all the years that I can count on you!</description>
