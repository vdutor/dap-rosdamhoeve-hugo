      <description>We also do home visits. In practice we have all the necessary equipment available, so it is preferable to come to us with your pet. If that is not possible, we will come to you at a slightly higher rate than a practical consultation. {{ .Site.Data.info.mobile | markdownify}}</description>

      <description>When we moved to St-Martens-Latem in 2007, I was looking for a vet for my dog ​​and cats. An acquaintance recommended Pascale to me. Trust is very important to me and I have certainly found that with Pascale. My pets are really a part of my life, and when they are sick, Pascale is always there for them. Pascale, thank you for all the years that I can count on you!</description>
