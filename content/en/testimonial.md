When we moved to St-Martens-Latem in 2007, I was looking for a vet for my dog ​​and cats.
An acquaintance recommended Pascale to me.
Trust is very important to me and I have certainly found that with Pascale.
My pets are really a part of my life, and when they are sick, Pascale is always there for them.
Pascale, thank you for all the years that I can count on you!
